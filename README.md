Hello, and welcome to my little opinionated island.  If you are easily offended, leave now.

**I am a minimalist** and dislike most things, with a level of passion commensurate with the needless complexity involved.

**I breathe Common Lisp** - and assembly when I need more control.  As a language geek, I can work with any, but find most vulgar, (except for Forth and Smalltalk).

**I live in deep rabbitholes** formed by structured data in my attempts to write editors, compilers, and nifty datastructures (especially probabilistic and immutable ones).  Occasionally I put on my EE hat and design hardware, often with FPGAs or 6502s.
