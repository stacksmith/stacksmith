Hello.
I am a minimalist -  and dislike most things, with a level of passion commensurate with the needless complexity.
I breathe Common Lisp - and assembly when needed.  A language geek, I work with many, but find most vulgar.
I live in deep rabbitholes - carved by structured data in my attempts to write editors, compilers, and nifty datastructures (especially probabilistic and immutable ones).  Occasionally I put on my EE hat and design hardware, often with FPGAs or 6502s.
