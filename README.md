! Hello !
+ I am a minimalist - and despise needless complexity.
+ I breathe Common Lisp - and assembly when needed.  As a language geek, I find most vulgar.
+ I live in deep rabbitholes - carved by structured data in my attempts to write editors, compilers, and nifty datastructures (especially probabilistic and immutable ones).  Occasionally I put on my EE hat and design hardware, often with FPGAs or 6502s.  
+ I need to get github... Why am I here?
