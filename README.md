Hello, and welcome to my little opinionated island.  If you are easily offended, please leave now.

I breathe Common Lisp - and assembly when I need more control (with an occasional Forth or Smalltalk bender).  As a language geek, I can work with anything (except possibly Haskell which just annoying).

I am a minimalist and dislike most things, with a level of passion commensurate with the needless complexity involved.  I tolerate complexity which is absolutely necessary to accomplish the absolutely-necessary goals.

I tend to focus on deep rabbitholes having to do with editing of structures, texty things, compilers, and nifty datastructures.
